This website is my version of a password generator. The user will find that he or she is able to create a password 8-128 characters in length. If the user tries to create a password shorter or longer than the specified range, he or she will be prompted to reselect a value within that range. Additionally, he or she has the option to include or exclude lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The password generator resets after each use, ensuring that each password is unique.
